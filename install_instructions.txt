Before you can use YouCompleteMe, you must compile it.

These instructions (using install.py) are the quickest way to install YouCompleteMe, however they may not work for everyone. If the following instructions don't work for you, check out the full installation guide.

Make sure you have Vim 7.4.1578 with Python 2 or Python 3 support. The Vim package on Fedora 27 and later and the pre-installed Vim on Ubuntu 16.04 and later are recent enough. You can see the version of Vim installed by running vim --version. If the version is too old, you may need to compile Vim from source (see compile_vim_from_source.txt).

Install development tools, CMake, and Python headers:

Fedora 27 and later:

sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ make python3-devel

Ubuntu 14.04:

sudo apt install build-essential cmake3 python3-dev

Ubuntu 16.04 and later:

sudo apt install build-essential cmake python3-dev

Compiling YCM with semantic support for C-family languages:

cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
python3 install.py --clang-completer
Compiling YCM without semantic support for C-family languages:

cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
python3 install.py
The following additional language support options are available:

C# support: install Mono and add --cs-completer when calling install.py.
Go support: install Go and add --go-completer when calling install.py.
JavaScript and TypeScript support: install Node.js and npm then install the TypeScript SDK with npm install -g typescript.
Rust support: install Rust and add --rust-completer when calling install.py.
Java support: install JDK8 (version 8 required) and add --java-completer when calling install.py.
To simply compile with everything enabled, there's a --all flag. So, to install with all language features, ensure xbuild, go, tsserver, node, npm, rustc, and cargo tools are installed and in your PATH, then simply run:

cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
python3 install.py --all
That's it. You're done. Refer to the User Guide section on how to use YCM. Don't forget that if you want the C-family semantic completion engine to work, you will need to provide the compilation flags for your project to YCM. It's all in the User Guide.

YCM comes with sane defaults for its options, but you still may want to take a look at what's available for configuration. There are a few interesting options that are conservatively turned off by default that you may want to turn on.
